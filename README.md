ICE AI is the **agentic intelligence layer** of the ICE ecosystem.

It defines how intelligent agents reason, plan, analyze, and act across
codebases, knowledge domains, workflows, and system state.

ICE AI does not provide raw models.
It provides **structured intelligence**, **decision-making**, and
**agent coordination** on top of underlying runtimes and cognition layers.

---

## Core Responsibilities

ICE AI is responsible for:

- Defining agent types, roles, and capabilities
- Planning and routing complex tasks
- Analyzing code, projects, and system state
- Reasoning over goals, constraints, and context
- Interfacing with LLMs through controlled adapters
- Producing decisions, not just generations

---

## Agentic Scope

ICE AI operates at the **decision and action layer**.

It does not:
- manage system lifecycle
- store long-term knowledge
- define public APIs
- control low-level execution

It does:
- interpret intent
- decompose objectives into tasks
- coordinate agents and tools
- reason over memory and context
- produce structured outcomes

---

## Design Principles

- Agents as first-class system components
- Explicit separation between reasoning and execution
- Planning before generation
- Decisions over raw text output
- LLMs treated as tools, not authorities
- Deterministic structures around probabilistic models

---

## Usage

ICE AI is not a standalone product.

It is consumed by:
- ICE Runtime
- ICE Engine
- ICE Studio
- Automation and orchestration layers

ICE AI agents operate **within** the ICE system, never in isolation.

---

## Status

This project is under **active development**.
Agent models and reasoning strategies may evolve as the system matures.
