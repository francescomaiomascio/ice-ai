# ICE AI
## Agentic Intelligence Layer of the ICE Ecosystem

ICE AI is the **agentic intelligence layer** of the ICE ecosystem.

It is responsible for **reasoning, planning, analysis, and decision formation**
across codebases, knowledge domains, workflows, and system state.

ICE AI does not execute actions.
ICE AI does not authorize behavior.
It produces **structured intent and decisions** under explicit constraints.

---

## Foundation Dependency

This project derives its assumptions, invariants, and boundaries from  
**ICE Foundation v1.0.0**.

ICE Foundation defines what is valid.  
ICE AI operates only within those constraints.

Any intelligent behavior that violates Foundation axioms or invariants
invalidates ICE compliance.

---

## Position in the ICE Architecture

ICE AI occupies a precise position in the ICE hierarchy:

**Foundation → Runtime → Engine → Intelligence (ICE AI) → Consciousness → Interfaces**

Within this structure:

- Runtime enforces execution and authority
- Engine coordinates causality and flow
- ICE AI produces intent, plans, and decisions
- Consciousness preserves memory and meaning

ICE AI has **no execution authority**.
It cannot bypass governance or reconfigure execution directly.

---

## What ICE AI Is

ICE AI is:

- an **agentic reasoning layer**
- a **planning and decision system**
- a **goal and constraint interpreter**
- a **coordination layer for agents and tools**
- a **producer of structured intent**

It exists to transform goals and context
into **explicit, inspectable decisions**.

---

## What ICE AI Is Not

ICE AI is **not**:

- a runtime
- an execution engine
- a memory system
- a source of authority
- a raw model provider
- a text-generation wrapper

ICE AI does not “act”.
It **decides what should be acted upon**.

---

## Core Responsibilities

ICE AI is responsible for:

- defining agent roles, capabilities, and boundaries
- decomposing objectives into executable plans
- reasoning over goals, constraints, and context
- analyzing codebases, projects, and system state
- coordinating agents and tool usage
- interfacing with language models through controlled adapters
- producing decisions, not just text output

All outputs of ICE AI are **intentions**, not actions.

---

## Agentic Model

ICE AI treats agents as **first-class system components**.

Key principles:

- reasoning is separated from execution
- planning precedes generation
- decisions are explicit and structured
- probabilistic models are wrapped in deterministic scaffolding
- language models are tools, not authorities

Intelligence without control is noise.
ICE AI exists to prevent that.

---

## Governance and Constraints

ICE AI operates under strict governance:

- it cannot authorize execution
- it cannot act autonomously
- it cannot bypass Runtime or Engine constraints
- it cannot adapt implicitly
- all decisions must remain traceable and attributable

Governance constraints are inherited from ICE Foundation
and are non-negotiable.

---

## Usage Model

ICE AI is not a standalone product.

It is embedded by:

- ICE Runtime
- ICE Engine
- ICE Studio
- automation and orchestration layers

ICE AI agents operate **within** the ICE system,
never in isolation and never without governance.

---

## Canonical Status

ICE AI is an **intelligence provider**, not an authority.

If ICE AI behavior attempts to execute actions,
override governance,
or self-authorize decisions,
it is incorrect by definition.

---

## Notes

Intelligence systems fail when reasoning and execution blur.

ICE AI exists to keep them separate,
even when doing so makes systems harder to build.
